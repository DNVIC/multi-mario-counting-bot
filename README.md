## FUTURE PLANS:
Support for the 1120 (will have to contact odyssey runners to make splits)

Client/Server Model (clients interact with a server which has the bot instead of the client hosting the bot itself)

Directly integrating the program with livesplit with a component (for an easier user experience)
